Early life
Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His mother Saroj Kohli is as a housewife while his father Prem Nath Kohli worked as a criminal lawyer. He has an elder brother Vikas and an elder sister Bhawna.[13] His formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. His early education was at Vishal Bharti Public School.[14] As per his family, Kohli exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a 3-year-old. He would pick up a bat and request his father bowl to him.[15]

In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy was created. In May, his father arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[1] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed his ability merited more than gully cricket.[16] He was unable to secure a place in the U-14 Delhi team, due to extraneous factors. His father reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would ensure his selection, but he declined the proposals.

Kohli found his way into the U-15 team.[1] He received training at the academy and participated in matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[17] In pursuit of furthering his cricketing career, he transferred to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education.[16]

On 18 December 2006, his father died due to a cerebral attack.[16][14] As per his mother, Kohli's demeanour shifted noticeably after his father's death. He took on cricket with newfound seriousness, prioritizing playing time and dedicating himself fully to the sport.[16] Kohli's family resided in Meera Bagh, Paschim Vihar until the year 2015, after which they relocated to Gurgaon.[18]

Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu Cricket Ground against Himachal Pradesh. His first half-century in domestic cricket happened at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Haryana.[1] By the end of the season, he had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average of 34.40.[19] During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed the captain of the U-15 team. He scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119. By the end of the season, he had a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.[20][1] Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi U-17 team. In the four matches that he played, Kohli had a total of 470 runs, with his highest score being 251* runs.

The team's coach, Ajit Chaudhary, lauded his performance and was particularly impressed with his temperament on the field.[1][21] He commenced the 2005–06 season with a score of 227 against Punjab. Following their victory over Uttar Pradesh in the quarter-finals, Delhi was scheduled to play against Baroda in the semi-finals. The team had high expectations from Kohli, who had promised his coach to finish the job. True to his word, Kohli went on to score 228 runs, leading Delhi to victory. The team later secured the tournament with a five-wicket win over Mumbai, where he contributed with a half-century in the first innings.[1] He ended as the highest run-scorer with a total of 757 runs from 7 matches, averaging 84.11.[22]

On 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy, but he did not get the opportunity to bat during the match.[23] In 2006, Kohli got a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was dismissed after scoring ten runs.[1] In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That night, Kohli's father passed away. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.[24] Chetan Chauhan, the coach, was impressed by his determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity. Venkatesh Prasad lauded his crucial knock, which was executed in the midst of an emotional upheaval.[25] After his dismissal, Kohli attended his father's funeral. His innings proved to be crucial for Delhi as they were able to avoid the follow-on. The team's captain, Mithun Manhas, praised Kohli for his performance, acknowledging its pivotal role in the team's success.[25]

Kohli's foray into T20 cricket first happened in April 2007, during the Inter-State T20 Championship, where he emerged as the top run-getter for his team with a tally of 179 runs at an average of 35.80.[26] In Sep 2008, Kohli played in Nissar Trophy against SNGPL. He emerged as the leading scorer for Delhi in both innings, registering 52 runs in the first innings and a towering 197 in the second. The match ultimately ended in a draw, SNGPL being declared the victors due to their lead in first innings.[27] In the 2009–10 Ranji Trophy season, Kohli returned to domestic cricket. During a match against Maharastra, he opened the batting and scored 67 runs, helping Delhi to secure the bonus point required for victory.[28] Kohli's performance reinvigorated the competitive spirit of the domestic cricket circuit.

I did not see him waste his time. If not on the field, he would be busy in the gym. I saw him first as a chubby-cheeked bubbly young kid who grew into a perfect athlete. His junior cricket lessons have obviously helped him. I did not know him well, but had heard a lot about his exploits in junior cricket.

India U19 team
In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s,[29] while also averaging 49 in the 3-match Test series.[30] Following India U-19 success in both the ODI and Test series, the team's coach Lalchand Rajput noted Kohli's adeptness in facing both pace and spin bowling and expressed his admiration for his technical prowess.[31] In September, the U-19 team toured Pakistan. In the first Test match, Kohli scored 63 and 28 as India won by 271 runs against Pakistan Under-19s. In the 2nd match, he contributed 83 runs to India's victory by 240 runs and an innings.

The series ended in a draw. In the following month, the team travelled to Malaysia for a tri-series against England Under-19s and Sri Lanka Under-19s, where Kohli did not get many opportunities to bat. In July–August, India U-19 embarked on a tour for a tri-series against Sri Lanka Under-19s and Bangladesh Under-19s, where he did not score a half-century in any of the matches. He made a comeback with scores of 144 and an unbeaten 94 in the following Test series.[1]

Kohli came into the limelight in 2008 when he led the team to victory in the U-19 World Cup. He led the Indian squad and won the 2008 U-19 World Cup held in Malaysia.[32] He amassed 235 runs at an average of 47, ranking as the tournament's third-highest scorer and one of three cricketers to compile a century.[33] His century, a knock of 100 runs off 74 balls, versus the West Indies Under-19s in a group stage encounter, was lauded by ESPNcricinfo, as "the innings of the tournament." This innings paved the way for India's 50-run triumph and fetched Kohli the man of the match award.[34] Additionally, Kohli's all-round performance in the semi-final against New Zealand Under-19s, where he captured 2 wickets and contributed 43 runs in the run-chase, was core to India's victory.[35] In the championship match, Kohli managed a score of 19 against South Africa Under-19s and his contribution lead to the eventual 12-run win (via D/L method).[36]

In June 2008, Kohli and his U-19 teammates Pradeep Sangwan and Tanmay Srivastava were awarded the Border–Gavaskar scholarship. This scholarship, aimed at honing the skills of the chosen cricketers, provided an opportunity to train for six weeks at Cricket Australia's Centre of Excellence in Brisbane.[37] In a bid to identify potential talent for the senior team, Kohli was selected to represent India Emerging Players in the Emerging Players Tournament 2008. His finest performance in the tournament was against New Zealand Emerging Players, where he played a knock of 120 runs, leading India to a seven-wicket victory. With an aggregate of 204 runs, Kohli's performances did not go unnoticed by the selectors who were observing his progress.

Beginnings with RCB (2007)
In 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India introduced the Indian Premier League, a franchise-based T20 league. Among the franchises, Royal Challengers Bangalore, owned by Vijay Mallya at the time, selected Kohli to join their team for a sum of $50,000 through a draft. This decision was influenced by his performance in the U19 World Cup in Malaysia which India won under him.[87]

Early seasons (2008–2009)
In the inaugural IPL match, Kohli played in a high-stakes encounter against the Kolkata Knight Riders where he lost his wicket early during the team's pursuit of a target of 223 runs.[88] As the event progressed, he found himself occupying a position in the middle order, but he was reinstated at the top order during the match against Deccan Charges. It was in this role that he rediscovered his form and made contributions to the cause.[89]

However, in the last two games, he had to sacrifice his preferred position in order to accommodate Misbah-ul-Haq, taking on the responsibility of batting in the middle order once again.[90] Concluding the season, Kohli's individual performance yielded a total of 165 runs, as Bangalore secured the seventh position on the points table.[91]

In the subsequent season, Kohli encountered a series of low scores in the initial 2 matches before bouncing back with a half-century in the third match against Deccan Chargers, in team's defeat.[92] Throughout the remainder of the season, Kohli displayed moderate performances or found limited opportunities to bat, owing to the dominance of top-order batsmen Jacques Kallis and Ross Taylor. This proved advantageous for the team, as they secured a spot in the playoffs.[93] In the semi-final against Chennai Super Kings, Kohli made contributions to the chase, leading Bangalore to the final.[94] In final against Deccan Charges, Bangalore fell short by a margin of 8 runs, thus concluding the season as runners-up.[95]

Rise, retention and realization (2010–2012)
In the 2010 season of the IPL, Kohli was the vice-captain for RCB and was positioned in the middle order. He augmented Bangalore's batting depth and made contributions to the team's success. Notably, his contribution was observed during a victory over the Kings XI Punjab, where he played an instrumental role in concluding the match.[96] His cameos in away fixtures against the Chennai Super Kings[97] and Kings XI Punjab, forging valuable partnerships, particularly with Kevin Pietersen, were crucial.[98] Kohli's standout performance came in an encounter against the Deccan Chargers, where he scored 58 runs at a strike rate of 165.[99] As the season progressed, Kohli's fielding prowess also came to the fore, furthering his contribution to the team's cause.[100] Upon securing a place in the playoffs, the Bangalore team confronted Mumbai Indians in the semi-final. Bangalore suffered a setback, succumbing to a defeat margin of 35 runs, thus ending Bangalore's campaign in the tournament.[101] In the Champions League Twenty20 held in September, Bangalore found themselves in an encounter against the Mumbai Indians. In pursuit of a target of 165 runs, Kohli played a steady innings, contributing 47 runs. The match came to the final ball, which resulted in Kohli's dismissal, leading to Bangalore falling short by a margin of 2 runs.[102] As a consequence, their upcoming game against the Lions became a virtual knockout match. In this must-win encounter, Kohli scored 49* runs, guiding his team to victory, securing a place in the semi-finals.[103] In the semi-final clash against the Chennai Super Kings, RCB faced a significant defeat of 52 runs.

Prior to the 2011 season of the IPL, Kohli was the sole player retained by Bangalore, for an amount of US$1.8 million.[104] In the opening match against the Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Kohli started his campaign with a score of 23 runs.[105] He registered his first half-century of the season against the Deccan Chargers, in pursuit of what was then the second-highest run chase, however Bangalore fell short by 33 runs.[106] After lacklustre start for Bangalore, winning two out of their first six matches, Kohli scored 56 runs in the next match against the Delhi Daredevils, and was awarded the player of the match for the first time in the tournament.[107] In the subsequent match, he continued his form against the Pune Warriors, where he claimed his second player of the match award. It was during this match that Kohli became the leading run-scorer of the season, donning the Orange cap, and he also surpassed the milestone of 1000 runs in the IPL.[108] With regular captain Daniel Vettori sustaining an injury, Kohli had the opportunity to captain his side for the first time in an IPL match.[109] Team's coach, Ray Jennings praised Kohli for his efforts, acknowledged his potential to become the future captain not only of the franchise but also of the Indian national team.[110] The team ended their league stage campaign on a high note, defeating the Chennai Super Kings and securing the top position on the table.[111]

In the first qualifier, Kohli scored 70 off 44 balls. Setting a target of 175 runs, RCB failed to defend, resulting in a knockout against the Mumbai Indians.[112] In the knockout match, Bangalore triumphed over Mumbai, securing their place in the IPL final for the second time. In the final, chasing a target of 205 runs, Kohli contributed 35 runs to the team's total. However, Bangalore once again fell short in their pursuit of the title.[113] During the season, Kohli amassed 557 runs with 4 half-centuries, and earning the distinction of being the second-highest run-scorer of the season, trailing West-Indian teammate Chris Gayle.[114] In the Champions League, RCB encountered a defeat in their first match against the Warriors. In the following match, Kohli got dismissed for a duck, leading to another loss for Bangalore. To secure a spot in the semi-finals, they needed to win their remaining two matches. In their last group-stage match against the Southern Redbacks, Kohli showcased his aggressive batting by scoring 70 runs off just 36 balls, propelling Bangalore into the semi-finals.[115] In the semi-final clash against the New South Wales Blues, Kohli once again played match-winning innings, scoring an unbeaten 84 runs.[116] However, in the final showdown against the Mumbai Indians, Bangalore suffered a defeat by a margin of 31 runs.


Kohli playing against CSK during 2014 IPL
In the 2012 season, Kohli had single-digit scores in the first 2 matches but bounced back in the 3rd match against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring 57 runs.[117] He reached a total of 165 runs by the 9tg game.[118] He managed to contribute 45 runs in the next match against the Kings XI Punjab to his team's cause.[119] As the season progressed, ineffectiveness of Bangalore's captain, Daniel Vettori, as a player led to a strategic alteration. Vettori made the decision to step down as captain and handed the leadership role to Kohli for the remaining matches of the season.[120] His breakthrough performance in the season came during the match against the Delhi Daredevils where he scored 73* and formed a record-breaking partnership of 203 runs with his teammate Gayle.[121] In their final match of the season, Bangalore faced the Deccan Chargers with the necessity of must-win to qualify for the playoffs. Kohli contributed 42 runs to the team's chase before being dismissed in the 16th over. His dismissal triggered a collapse in Bangalore's batting order, resulting in their eventual defeat and elimination from the tournament during the group stage.[122] During the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 364 runs, garnered over the course of 16 matches. He returned from the League with a sense of disillusionment with his own performance and was dissatisfied with the state of his game. He recognized the need for improvement and adaptation to the evolving dynamics of cricket.[123]

Leadership role (2013–2014)
Following Vettori's retirement, Kohli assumed the role of full-time captain for the Bangalore team starting from the 2013 season of the IPL. Prior to the commencement of this season, he was highest run-scorer for Bangalore with a tally of 1,639 runs.[124] Kohli embarked on the tournament with a consistent start, but suffered a loss against the Sunrisers Hyderabad in an away game.[125] In their subsequent home match, once again against Hyderabad, Kohli scored unbeaten 93 while chasing, marking his highest individual score in Twenty20 cricket at that time.[126] Continuing his form, Kohli went on to score back-to-back fifties in the matches against the Chennai Super Kings and the Delhi Daredevils, the latter of which was decided through a super over.[127] After a defeat against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli found himself embroiled in a disagreement with the crowd due to their aggressive demeanour towards the visiting team at the Wankhede Stadium.[128] As the mid-season approached, Kohli encountered a dip in his performance, managing 45 runs in four innings.[129] He bounced back during the away game against Delhi, where he came close to achieving a century, scoring 99 before being run out on the final delivery.[130] With a strong start to the season that saw Bangalore occupying the top position in the table, the team's performance waned in the latter half of the tournament.[131] Kohli openly addressed the issue, attributing their decline to a lack of execution by the bowling unit.[132] In a bid to keep their playoff hopes alive, Bangalore confronted a must-win scenario in their final match against Chennai. Opening the innings, Kohli scored an unbeaten 56 in a rain-affected match, ultimately leading his team to victory.[133] However, Bangalore's hopes were shattered when the Hyderabad secured a win over the Kolkata Knight Riders, dashing their chances of advancing to the playoffs. As a result, Bangalore's season came to an end during the group stage.[134]

Prior to the seventh season of the IPL, Kohli was retained by Bangalore for ₹12.5 crore (US$1.4 million).[135] His campaign commenced with an unbeaten score of 49 runs in a victorious encounter against the Delhi Daredevils.[136] However, Kohli struggled to maintain his form and faced a dismissal without scoring in the second match. In a match against the Rajasthan Royals, Bangalore's batting lineup faltered, resulting in them being bowled out for 70, then third-lowest total in IPL history. Kohli contributed 21 runs to the team's total in that particular match.[137] Bangalore heavily relied on the performances of Gayle and Kohli in their batting lineup, but neither of them had managed a significant innings thus far in the season.[138] Kohli's struggles persisted as he recorded his third duck of the season in a match against the Kings XI Punjab.[139] In an effort to address the batting woes, Kohli made the decision to alter his batting position and open the innings; however, this adjustment did not yield the desired outcome.[140] With Bangalore losing six out of their nine games, Kohli had yet to reach the milestone of scoring a half-century.

At the outset of the 2015 season of the IPL, Kohli expressed his optimism about playing with reduced pressure, attributing it to the strengthened middle order of the Bangalore team.[144] Kohli strategically decided to open the batting alongside Gayle for the season. In the second match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, he scored 41 runs, providing a moderate start to his campaign.[145] Continuing his form, Kohli achieved his first half-century of the season, albeit in a match that ended in defeat against the Chennai Super Kings.[146] In the subsequent match, Kohli again notched a fifty, leading Bangalore to victory and ending their three-match losing streak.[147] During this match, he promoted AB de Villiers up the batting order, recognizing the importance of having the team's premier batsman face more deliveries.[148] Bangalore, looking to overcome their previous struggles in the bowling department, successfully bowled out the Delhi Daredevils for 95 runs, while Kohli guided his team to a ten-wicket victory during the chase.[149] However, in an away game against Chennai, Kohli fell short of reaching a half-century, scoring 48 runs before being run out by Dwayne Bravo due to a momentary lapse in judgment.

Nonetheless, he managed to continue playing due to breach's absence of severity.[153] Qualifying for the playoffs for the first time under his captaincy, Kohli held firm confidence in the turnaround his team had showcased during the later stages of the league.[154] However, in the qualifier 2 against Chennai, Kohli's dismissal for 12 runs proved detrimental to Bangalore's chances, resulting in their defeat and the conclusion of their campaign for the season. Throughout the season, Kohli accumulated a total of 505 runs in 16 matches with an average of 45.90, then third-highest run tally achieved by him in a single season.[155]

In the 2016 season of the IPL, Kohli's campaign began with 75 runs, contributing to a victory of 45 runs against the Sunrisers Hyderabad.[156] He continued his run in the subsequent match, scoring 79 runs. Throughout the early matches, Kohli consistently achieved the milestone of scoring half-centuries in three out of the four matches he played, while sharing three century partnerships with de Villiers.[157] In the encounter against the Gujarat Lions, he registered his first century in Twenty20 cricket. Although the match ended in defeat for his team, Kohli's knock earned him the player of the match.[158] Despite Kohli's performances, Bangalore struggled in the league stage, securing only two victories out of their seven matches and finding themselves in the seventh position on the points table.[159] To revive their chances of qualifying for the playoffs, Bangalore needed to win six out of their next seven matches. In the subsequent match, Kohli scored a century in a successful chase against Rising Pune Supergiant as Bangalore's virtual knockouts began.[160] He continued to deliver match-winning performances, forming a record partnership of 229 runs with de Villiers against the Gujarat,[161] followed by playing a knock of 75* against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[162] In a rain-affected match against the Kings XI Punjab, Kohli achieved his fourth century of the season, surpassing the milestone of 4,000 runs in the league.[163] His batting drew high praise from Harsha Bhogle, who lauded his technical proficiency and shot-making.[164] Kohli's consistent performances propelled Bangalore to the playoffs, as he scored four consecutive fifty-plus scores in must-win matches and finished the league stage with tally of 919 runs.[165] In the playoffs, Bangalore faced Gujarat in the first qualifier.

Virat has been phenomenal. When you have got a guy at the top of the order who takes that much control and his performances are that great, it allows things to flow from there. Obviously a great captain does that — leads with his performance and he has been exceptional not only with his batting, but also fielding and leadership.

Fluctuating form and captaincy struggles (2017–2019)

Kohli celebrating his fifty against Mumbai Indians
In the lead-up to the tenth season of the IPL, Kohli grappled with a shoulder injury, which sidelined him for the initial three fixtures of the tournament.[170] Upon his return in the fourth match against the Mumbai Indians, he scored 62 runs, albeit in a defeat for Bangalore.[171] Following this performance, Kohli delivered moderately in the subsequent two matches. However, in the face-off against the Kolkata Knight Riders, Kohli faced a setback after being dismissed for a duck as Bangalore stumbled to league's lowest score of 49 runs. He promptly criticized the batting display as reckless.[172] In the encounter against the Rising Pune Supergiant, Kohli contributed 55 runs to his team's total of 96 runs. Expressing disappointment, Kohli attributed the team's struggles to a lack of intent and a fearful batting approach.[173] With Bangalore facing defeat in seven out of their ten matches, their hopes for playoffs were dashed, particularly after their loss to the Mumbai Indians, making them the first team to be eliminated from contention.[174] Wrapping up the tournament, Bangalore secured a victory in their last match against Delhi Daredevils, with Kohli scoring his fourth fifty of the season and amassing a total of 308 runs in 10 innings.[175] Kohli concluded that the season as a whole was the team's most underwhelming performance to date.[176] Commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the league, ESPNcricinfo honoured Kohli by including him in the all-time IPL-XI.[177]

"He is a consummate surgeon at the crease, intensely focused, working hard, playing the ball into gaps in the field and staying calm under pressure. He is always judging the right time to consolidate and the right time to seize a game by the scruff of the neck."

 – Kohli's RCB team mate AB de Villiers
Prior to the commencement of the 2018 season, Bangalore retained Kohli for sum of ₹17 crore (US$1.9 million), making him the league's most expensive player at the time.[178] His campaign began with 33 runs in a defeat against the Kolkata Knight Riders, where he expressed his discontentment with the number of dot balls he faced.[179] In contrast to his individual performances, which included twin fifties in the third and fourth matches, temporarily securing him the Orange Cap, Bangalore found themselves consistently on the losing side.[180] This predicament was primarily attributed to the team's heavy reliance on Kohli and his partner de Villiers in the batting lineup, coupled with their challenges in the bowling department, which Kohli critiqued as being "criminal".[181] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore gradually discovered their winning rhythm, propelled by Kohli's contributions, including scores of 70 and 48* in must-win encounters against Delhi Daredevils and Kings XI Punjab, respectively.[182] He eventually surpassed the milestone of 500 runs in the season, a feat he accomplished for a record fifth time.[183] However, in the decisive encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli faltered, managing 4 runs before succumbing to dismissal. This setback ultimately led to Bangalore's elimination from the tournament. In the aftermath of their exit, Kohli publicly scrutinized the team's middle-order batsmen for their failure to deliver substantial contributions during crucial matches, reflecting on the missed opportunities that defined their campaign.[184]

Kohli's start to the 2019 season proved underwhelming, as he managed 6 runs in the opener against the Chennai Super Kings.[185] Consequently, he opted to move down the batting order in an attempt to provide more depth. However, his struggle with form persisted, reflecting in Bangalore's losses and prompting a quick reversal of the decision.[186] In an encounter against the Rajasthan Royals, Kohli marked his 100th appearance as Bangalore's captain.[187] Albeit, that match ended in defeat, extending the team's losing streak to four consecutive matches. Former cricketer Gautam Gambhir weighed in on Kohli's lengthy tenure as captain, suggesting luck may have played a part despite his underwhelming performance as leader.[188] Kohli eventually found his rhythm in the fifth match, where he managed to score a half-century against the Kolkata Knight Riders.[189] However, Bangalore's string of losses persisted, prompting him to acknowledge his team's lackluster performance thus far.[190] After enduring record six consecutive defeats, Bangalore secured their first victory against the Kings XI Punjab, with Kohli contributing 67 runs in that match.[191] Subsequently, he scored his fifth century in the league;[192] however, his subsequent form saw a dip, as he struggled to make significant contributions with the bat in Bangalore's successive victories. These wins, were not enough as Bangalore fell short in their bid to advance further in the tournament, marking their third consecutive elimination under Kohli's captaincy.[193] Reflecting on the season, he expressed satisfaction with the team's turnaround in the latter stages of the tournament, acknowledging the progress made despite their early challenges.[194]

Performance plunge and captaincy departure (2020–2022)
Following the resumption of cricket post the COVID-19 lockdown, Kohli returned to the field with cautious optimism.[195] However, positioned at number 3, his start to the 2020 season was lackluster, tallying a total of 18 runs across the first three matches. In the fourth match, Kohli found his rhythm, and scored 72 runs against the Rajasthan Royals.[196] His momentum continued as he played his standout innings of the season against the Chennai Super Kings, scoring an unbeaten 90.[197] Throughout the season, Kohli adhered to a strategy of accumulating runs primarily through singles and doubles, thereby minimizing the reliance on boundaries.[198] Under his captaincy, Bangalore secured victories in five of their opening eight matches, with Kohli himself contributing moderately, amassing a total of 389 runs by the conclusion of eleven matches.[199] However, during the latter part of the season, Kohli's form dipped, coinciding with Bangalore's consecutive losses in four matches following their promising start.[200] Despite these setbacks, Bangalore managed to qualify for the playoffs due to their net run rate.[201] Kohli concluded the league stage with a cumulative total of 460 runs, albeit with a slower strike rate of 122. Analysts at ESPNcricinfo attributed this performance in part to the distinctive conditions of the season, notably the relocation of matches to the UAE, where larger boundaries and an inexperienced middle order might have influenced Kohli's risk-averse approach.[202] In the playoffs, Bangalore encountered the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the eliminator. Kohli, assuming the opening position alongside Devdutt Padikkal, encountered an early setback, scoring 7 runs before his dismissal. Bangalore succumbed in the knockout encounter, prompting Kohli to reflect on a palpable sense of nervousness among the players, which contributed to their defeat.[203]

Ahead of the 2021 season opener, Kohli emphasized the strategic advantages of neutral venues for his team.[204] In their inaugural match against the Mumbai Indians, Kohli commenced with a score of 33, which he replicated in the subsequent fixture.[205] Notably, his first half-century of the season came against the Rajasthan Royals, where he scored an unbeaten 72, leading Bangalore to secure victory in four consecutive encounters.[206] Upon the resumption of the league in September, Kohli became the first player to make 200 appearances for a singular franchise.[207] Concurrently, Kohli announced his intention to relinquish the captaincy of Bangalore at the season's end, this decision was met with speculation, with Sandip of The Indian Express suggesting that it could potentially afford Kohli to play with more freedom.[208] In subsequent fixtures, Kohli scored consecutive half-centuries against the Chennai Super Kings[209] and Mumbai, his innings against the latter also marked the completion of 10,000 runs in T20 cricket.[210] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore qualified for the playoffs, with two games to spare, attributed to performances by Glenn Maxwell and Harshal Patel in their respective domains.[211] However, Kohli experienced a dip in form leading up to the playoffs, as Bangalore prepared to face Kolkata Knight Riders in the eliminator. In the knockout clash, where he notched up 39 runs, Bangalore was unable to secure victory, thus concluding Kohli's tenure as captain. In his post-match discourse, Kohli reaffirmed his commitment to delivering his utmost for Bangalore, while expressing gratitude for the loyalty and support extended by the franchise.[212]

Prior to the onset of the 2022 season, Bangalore chose to retain Kohli for a sum of ₹15 crore (US$1.7 million).[213] With Faf Du Plessis taking over the captaincy reins, Kohli commenced the season with a score of 41* against the Punjab Kings. However, positioned at number 3, Kohli's subsequent innings were marked by inconsistency, with sole significant contribution of 48 runs against the Mumbai Indians. Struggling to regain his form, Kohli endured two consecutive ducks in matches against the Lucknow Super Giants and Sunrisers Hyderabad. By the seventh match of the season, Kohli found himself registering single-digit scores in four out of seven matches, accumulating a total of 119 runs at an average of 17.[214] Cricket analyst Jarrod Kimber, writing for ESPNcricinfo, remarked that Kohli's batting seemed enigmatic and uncertain.[215] In an attempt to rectify his batting woes, Kohli was elevated to the opening position alongside du Plessis. It was in the tenth match that he managed to secure his maiden half-century of the season, albeit in 45 balls, marking it as his slowest in the T20 format.[216] However, his struggles persisted, as he encountered another duck against Hyderabad, accumulating a total of 216 runs in twelve matches.[217] Former Indian coach Ravi Shastri expressed his apprehension, suggesting that Kohli appeared "overcooked" and advocated for a break to rejuvenate himself. In concurrence with Shastri's assessment, Kohli asserted that he did not feel the need to prove himself to anyone and believed in his ability to bounce back.[218] As the tournament progressed, Bangalore found themselves in a precarious position, requiring a victory in their final league match to remain in contention for the playoffs. Kohli rose to the occasion, scoring 73 runs against Gujarat Titans, and propelling Bangalore to victory.[219] However, Kohli faltered in the subsequent eliminator and qualifier 2, spelling the culmination of Bangalore's campaign.

In the 2023 season, Kohli commenced his campaign with a score of 82* runs against the Mumbai Indians.[220] He maintained his form in subsequent matches, registering fifties in three out of the first four matches.

Reflecting on this tactical shift, Kohli noted that the middle overs are when teams typically introduce their premier bowlers, necessitating the assessment of the game's evolving dynamics.[221] Moreover, in the absence of regular captain du Plessis, Kohli assumed the role of stand-in captain for several matches, while du Plessis contributed as an impact player.[222] Eight matches into the season, Kohli had scored fifties in five of them.[223] However, an altercation marred a match against the Lucknow Super Giants, where Kohli found himself in a confrontation with Gambhir, resulting in a fine for breaching the code of conduct.[224] Throughout the season, Kohli relied on his placement and running between the wickets to maintain a scoring rate above a run a ball.[225] As the season progressed, Bangalore needed victories in their final two games to clinch a spot in the playoffs. Kohli stepped up in a pivotal match against the Sunrisers Hyderabad, scoring a century, to secure a win for his team.[226] In the subsequent fixture, he scored another century, surpassing Gayle for the most centuries in the league.
