## Tokenization

This is a quick demonstration to cover basics of tokenization for my Introduction to NLP class at the Indian Institute of Science. This is largely inspired from Andrej Karpathy's awesome [tokenization library](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) and [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=6602s).
